This is a Discord bot meant to be a frontend for generating various randomizers and outputting the files automatically.

This assumes that you already have Discord.js installed along with all of its dependencies.

This also assumes that you already have the randomizers installed along with all their dependencies, along with all of the necessary ROMs.

I will likely add a guide to installing everything in the future, but will never provide the ROMs.

Because I cannot provide the ROMs, the scope of this project growing to support multiple Discord servers is unlikely; this is meant for people to generate their own instances of the bot.

This is very much under construction.

To function, you must:

rename config.default to config.json, populate the necessary fields, and remove all the comments

rename ./modules/lttpr_mw/generate_presets.default to generate_presets.json

*Currently, there are still some hard-coded links that will be corrected upon rewrite. If you stumble upon this before that point, well... get in contact.

This is my first real coding project, so please be understanding.
